# Challenge 4: Alert Web Component Closable

**Description:** Create an alert web component that changes its top border color based on the variant and can be closable.

**Task:** Create a custom element `<challenge-4>` that displays an alert message with the following features:

- **Variants**: primary, success, neutral, warning, danger
- **Slots:** A default slot for content and an optional title slot for a bold title above the content
- **Closable**: A property to determine if the alert can be closed, if closed is set add a close button to the alert that hides the alert when clicked
- **Open**: A reflective property to determine if the alert is open

**Requirements:**

1. Use Lit to define the custom element.
2. Use a default slot for the alert content, if no slotted content has been provided show the default message.
3. Use an optional title slot for a bold title above the content.
4. The top border color should change based on the variant property.
5. The alert should have a open property to reflects it current status.
6. The alert should have a closable property to determine if a close button is shown.
7. The alert should be removed from the DOM when closed.
8. The alert should have show and hide methods to set their open status.
9. The alert should emit a custom event after it has closed.
10. **(Extra):** make the closable button accessible (keyboard, focus state, aria labels etc..)
